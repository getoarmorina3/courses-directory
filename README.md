# Create React App

This project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Routing is the process of matching a URL to the set of components being rendered. Routing dynamically loads components and changes what's displayed in the browser as users navigate an app, all without reloading the page. React does not have built-in routing features, so developers rely on React Router, an external library designed specifically for React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
